				<p>A computer is a machine that manipulates data according to a list of instructions.</p>
				<p>The first devices that resemble modern computers date to the mid-20th century (1940–1945), although the computer concept and various machines similar to computers existed earlier. Early electronic computers were the size of a large room, consuming as much power as several hundred modern personal computers(PC).[1] Modern computers are based on tiny integrated circuits and are millions to billions of times more capable while occupying a fraction of the space.[2] Today, simple computers may be made small enough to fit into a wristwatch and be powered from a watch battery. Personal computers, in various forms, are icons of the Information Age and are what most people think of as "a computer"; however, the most common form of computer in use today is the embedded computer. Embedded computers are small, simple devices that are used to control other devices — for example, they may be found in machines ranging from fighter aircraft to industrial robots, digital cameras, and children's toys.</p>
				<p>Information technology (IT),as defined by the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA),is "the study,design,development,implementation,support or management of computer-based information systems,particularly software applications and computer hardware." IT deals with the use of electronic computers and computer software to convert,store,protect,process,transmit,and securely retrieve information.
Today,the term information has ballooned to encompass many aspects of computing and technology,and the term has become very recognizable.IT professionals perform a variety of duties that range from installing applications to designing complex computer networks and information databases.A few of the duties that IT professionals perform may include data management,networking,engineering computer hardware,database and software design,as well as the management and administration of entire systems.Information technology is starting to spread farther than the conventional personal computer and network technology,and more into integrations of other technologies such as the use of cell phones,televisions,automobiles,and more,which is increasing the demand for such jobs.
When computer and communications technologies are combined,the result is information technology,or "info-tech".Information technology is a general term that describes any technology that helps to produce,manipulate,store,communicate,and/or disseminate information.</p>
